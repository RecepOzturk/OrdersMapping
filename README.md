# OrdersMapping

It's about orders assigning to different store as optimal.

Problem Definition:
 We have 100 orders with different coordinates and 3 store that has different name (red, green blue)
  Red store has capacitated: 20-30
  Green store : 30-80
  Blue store : 20 - 50 
  
  Thats mean: Red store has to delivery min 20 orders - max 30 orders.
